# Data Mining for Cybersecurity
This repository contains materials, scripts, and notebooks related to **Data Mining techniques applied to Cybersecurity**.  
The project focuses on analyzing security-related datasets to extract insights, detect patterns, and support defensive or analytical tasks.
## Project Goals
- Apply **data mining and data analysis techniques** to cybersecurity use cases
- Explore datasets related to security events, attacks, or network behavior
- Provide examples and experiments useful for academic or learning purposes
## Repository Contents
Typical contents of the repository may include:
- Python scripts for data preprocessing and analysis
- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experiments
- Datasets (or references to external datasets)
- Documentation and notes related to cybersecurity data mining techniques
## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Common Python data science libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib / seaborn
  - scikit-learn
  - jupyter
## Setup
- Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```
## Usage
Typical workflow:
- Load or import the cybersecurity dataset
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Apply data mining or machine learning techniques
- Analyze and visualize results
- Interpret findings in a cybersecurity context
Scripts and notebooks are meant to be adapted and extended based on the specific dataset or experiment.
